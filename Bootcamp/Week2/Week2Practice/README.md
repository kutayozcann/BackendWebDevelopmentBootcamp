# Week2Practice Project

## Description
This project includes various C# programming exercises aimed at improving coding skills through practical examples. Each task demonstrates the implementation of different programming concepts such as conditional statements, loops, methods, and string manipulations.

## Features
- Basic console outputs and string formatting
- Random number generation and mathematical operations
- Conditional statements for decision-making
- Looping structures for repetitive tasks
- Method creation for modular code development
- Input handling and validation
- Array resizing for dynamic data storage

## Questions Implemented
1. Console output with line breaks.
2. String and integer variable initialization and display.
3. Random number generation.
4. Mathematical modulus operations.
5. Age validation using conditional statements.
6. Loop to display repeated messages.
7. String swapping using temporary variables.
8. Method without a return value.
9. Method with integer addition and return value.
10. Boolean to string conversion.
11. Finding the largest age among three values.
12. Finding the largest number from user input.
13. String swapping using references.
14. Even or odd number detection.
15. Distance calculation based on speed and time.
16. Circle area calculation based on radius.
17. String case conversions (upper and lower).
18. Trimming whitespace from strings.

## Prerequisites
